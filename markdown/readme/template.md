# MinitestLog

Use class ```MinitestLog``` to simplify and organize the testing you're doing with class ```Minitest::Test```.

With ```MinitestLog```, you get two things:
 
- **Verdicts**:
  - All verdicts are automatically logged.
  - Verdicts for certain collections are closely analyzed (e.g., ```Hash```, ```Sets```).
- **Sections** that can have:
  - Nested subsections
  - Verdicts
  - Text
  - Attributes
  - Duration
  - Timestamp
  - Rescue
