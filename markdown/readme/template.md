# MinitestLog


```MinitestLog``` gives you three things:

- **Nested sections:**  Use nested sections to structure your test, so that it can "tell its story" clearly.
- **Data explication:**  Use data-logging methods to log objects. Most collections (```Aray```, ```Hash```, etc.) are explicated piece-by-piece.
- **Verdicts:** Use verdict methods to express assertions. A verdict method call an underlying assertion method (in ```Minitest::Assertions```).  Details for the verdict are logged, whether passed or failed.

## Installation

```
gem install minitest_log
```
