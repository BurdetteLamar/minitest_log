# MinitestLog

This ```minitest_log``` project provides logging for use with gem ```minitest```.

With ```minitest_log```:
 
- Each assertion is fully logged:  expected and actual values, along with an optional message.
- A failed assertion does not terminate the test.  (That's why I call it a *verdict*, and not an *assertion*.)
- You can structure the test code into *nested sections* that are carried forward into the log.

## Logged Assertions
