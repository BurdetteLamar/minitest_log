# MinitestLog


```MinitestLog``` gives you three things:

- **Nested sections:**  Use nested sections to structure your test (and its log), so that it can "tell its story" clearly.
- **Data explication:**  Use data-logging methods to log objects. Most collections (```Aray```, ```Hash```, etc.) are automatically logged in detail.
- **(And of course) Verdicts:** Use verdict methods to express assertions.  Details for the verdict are logged, whether passed or failed.
