# MinitestLog


```MinitestLog``` layers structured logging onto module ```Minitest```.

```MinitestLog``` allows you to:

- Organize your test code as nested sections, so the test can "tell its story."  That same structure carries forward into the test's execution log.
- Specify verdicts that are logged in detail, whether passed or failed.

(Here, we say *verdict*, not *assertion*, to emphasize that a failure does not terminate the test.)

## Installation

```
gem install minitest_log
```
