# MinitestLog

```MinitestLog``` allows you to:

- Structure your test code as nested sections.  The same structure carries forward into the test's execution log.
- Specify verdicts (verifications) that are fully logged, whether passed or failed.

(Here, we say *verdict*, not *assertion*, to emphasize that a failure does not terminate the test.)
