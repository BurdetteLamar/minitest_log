### Formatted Text

Put formatted text onto a section by calling method ```put_pre```.

Whitespace, including newlines, is preserved.

The formatted text in the log is more readable if it begins and ends with suitable whitespace, so by default the method displays the text with enhanced whitespace if needed.

You can specify ```verbatim = true``` to suppress the enhancement.
