### Formatted Text

Put formatted text onto a section by calling method ```put_pre```.

Whitespace, including newlines, is preserved.

By default, the method adds leading and trailing newlines, if they're not already there, to improve readability.

You can specify ```verbatim = true``` to suppress that behavior.
