### Attributes

Put attributes onto a section by calling ```section``` with hash arguments.

Each name/value pair in a hash becomes an attribute in the log section element.

The first argument is always the section name.  Following hash arguments become attributes.

@[ruby](example.rb)

@[xml](log.xml)
