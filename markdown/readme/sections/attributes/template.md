### Attributes

You can put attributes onto a section by calling ```section``` with hash arguments.

Each name/value pair in the hash becomes an attribute in the log section header.

The first argument is always the section name.  Additional hash arguments become attributes.

@[ruby](example.rb)

@[xml](log.xml)
