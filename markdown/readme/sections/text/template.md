### Text

Put text onto a section by calling method ```section``` with string arguments.

As before, the first argument is the section name; other string arguments become text.

Multiple string arguments are concatenated into the text.

Note that you can also put text onto a section by calling method ```put_data```.  See [Data](#data) below.

@[ruby](example.rb)
