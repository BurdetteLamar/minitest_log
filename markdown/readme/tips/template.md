## Tips

### Use Short Verdict Aliases

Use the short alias for a verdict method, to:

- Have less source code.
- Allow code-completion to work *much* better (completion select list gets shorter *much* sooner).

Examples:

- ```log.va_equal?```, not ```log.verdict assert_equal?```.
- ```log.vr_empty?```, not ```log.verdict_refute_empty?```.

### Avoid Failure Clutter

Use verdict return values (```true```/```false```) to omit verdicts that would definitely fail.  This can greatly simplify your test results.

In the example below, the test attempts to create a user.  If the create succeeds, the test further validates, then deletes the user.

However, if the create fails, the test does not attempt to validate or delete the user (which attempts would fail, and might raise exceptions).

Thus, assuming a failed create returns ```nil```:

```ruby
user_name = 'Bill Jones'
user = SomeApi.create_user(user_name)
if log.verdict_refute_nil?(:user_created, user)
  log.verdict_assert_equal?(:user_name, user_name, user.name)
  SomeApi.delete_user(user.id)
end
```

### Surround Pre-Formatted Text With Newlines

Method ```put_cdata``` puts pre-formatted text, adding nothing and omitting nothing.

Therefore, the text in the log abuts the enclosing square brackets at the beginning and end.

Add an extra newline at the beginning and end, to make the text in the log "free standing."
