## About This README

This README page is kept "green" because in addition to the tests, there's a rake task that:

- Executes the [50 example scripts](markdown/readme), capturing their output.
- Uses file inclusion to assemble this ```README.md``` file.

Shameless plug:  GitHub flavored markdown does not support file inclusion, but my Ruby gem [markdown_helper](https://rubygems.org/gems/markdown_helper) does.  It's a  [GitHub project](https://github.com/BurdetteLamar/markdown_helper#markdown-helper), too.
